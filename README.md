## Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.
The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.
The returned dictionary should follow this format:

{
  'mean': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'variance': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'standard deviation': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'max': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'min': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'sum': [axis1, axis2, flattened]
}

If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, it should raise a ValueError exception with the message: "List must contain nine numbers." The values in the returned dictionary should be lists and not Numpy arrays.

For example, calculate([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]) should return:

{
  'mean': [[3.0, 4.0, 5.0], [1.0, 4.0, 7.0], 4.0],
  'variance': [[6.0, 6.0, 6.0], [0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666, 0.6666666666666666], 6.666666666666667],
  'standard deviation': [[2.449489742783178, 2.449489742783178, 2.449489742783178], [0.816496580927726, 0.816496580927726, 0.816496580927726], 2.581988897471611],
  'max': [[6, 7, 8], [2, 5, 8], 8],
  'min': [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 6], 0],
  'sum': [[9, 12, 15], [3, 12, 21], 36]
} 

## Demographic Data Analyzer

In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted
from the 1994 Census database. You must use Pandas to answer the following questions:
- How many people of each race are represented in this dataset? This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels. (race column)
- What is the average age of men?
- What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
- What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
- What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
- What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
- What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
- What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
- Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.
